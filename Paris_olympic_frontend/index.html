                It was Popovici’s first Olympic medal after missing out in Tokyo 2020, where he came fourth. He had to
                work hard for the win on Monday with Germany’s Lukas Maertens, who claimed the 400m gold medal on
                Saturday, opening up a lead in the opening 150m of the race.

                But Popovici finished strongly, clawing back his rivals to touch first in a thrilling finale.
                <br> <br>
                Popovici was all smiles following his gold-medal performance, a first gold medal in swimming for
                Romania. Popovici finished in fourth at Tokyo 2020, making this also a moment of redemption for the
                19-year-old.

                "I feel amazing," said Popovici. "It is so great to be here. So many Romanians in the crowd. It’s
                beautiful, it’s a dream come true. I don’t know how to describe it. It’s so simple, yet so beautiful.”

                Down to the top four in the men's javelin throw final. Czechia's Jakub Vadlejch needs to find 4cm to
                move into the medals, but his last attempt won't be enough.

                Anderson Peters, Neeraj Chopra, and Arshad Nadeem sit in the bronze, silver, and gold medal positions.
                Will that order change?

                If anyone is to take down Arshad Nadeem at the top, they will need to throw an Olympic record.

                It won't be Peters, who's short of 85m on his last throw and wins bronze on a best effort of 88.54m.

                Defending champion Neeraj has never cracked 90m in his career. Can he finally do so here?
                <br> <br>

                It won't be Peters, who's short of 85m on his last throw and wins bronze on a best effort of 88.54m.

                Defending champion Neeraj has never cracked 90m in his career. Can he finally do so here?

                Not this time. That's going to be short too, and that ends his reign as the current Olympic champion
                with a best throw of 89.45m. It'll be his friend from across the border, Arshad, who will replace him as
                the champion, keeping the gold medal in Asia.

                Manu Bhaker won the first medal for India at the Paris 2024 Olympics. She bagged a bronze and became the
                first Indian woman to win an Olympic shooting medal. She then created history by becoming the first
                Indian to win two medals at a single edition of the Olympics after she clinched a mixed team 10m air
                pistol bronze with Sarabjot Singh.
                <br> <br>
                Indian shooters Manu Bhaker and Sarabjot Singh scripted history with a bronze medal in the 10m air
                pistol mixed team shooting event at the Paris 2024 Olympics on Tuesday.

                This was India's sixth Olympic medal in shooting and first-ever in a shooting team event. The result
                also made Manu Bhaker the first athlete of independent India to win two medals in one edition of the
                Olympics. On Sunday, Manu Bhaker became the first Indian woman to win an Olympic medal in shooting.

                Competing at the National Shooting Center in Chateauroux, Manu Bhaker and Sarabjot Singh defeated the
                Republic of Korea's Oh Ye Jin and Wonho Lee 16-10 in the bronze medal match. Oh Ye Jin won the gold
                medal in the women's 10m air pistol event on Sunday.

                Manu Bhaker started strongly, shooting a 10.2 on her opening shot. Sarabjot Singh's 8.6 cost India the
                first two points but he recovered quickly with scores of 10.5, 10.4 and 10 to help India take the next
                six points.

                <h2 class="desc">POLE VAULT</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Armand ‘Mondo’ Duplantis has done it again.

                The Swedish pole vaulter flew over the bar at a new world record height of 6.25m, having already secured
                Paris 2024 gold earlier in the evening on Monday, 5 August with a vault of 6.00m.

                This is the ninth time Duplantis has broken the world record, beating the mark of 6.24m he set in the
                Xiamen Diamond League in April this year.

                “I haven’t processed how fantastic that moment was," he said after his historic jump. "It’s one of those
                things that don’t really feel real, such an out-of-body experience. It’s still hard to kind of land
                right now.
                <br> <br>
                "What can I say? I just broke a world record at the Olympics, the biggest possible stage for a pole
                vaulter. [My] biggest dream since a kid was to break the world record at the Olympics, and I’ve been
                able to do that in front of the most ridiculous crowd I’ve ever competed in front of.”

                The crowd he spoke of in the Stade de France has become used to breathtaking moments at these Olympics,
                but few can compare to this mammoth effort from Duplantis.
